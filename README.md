This is the frontend for an application I built to record various data about my sleep. You can find the backend in the sleep-backend-api repository. The interface is based on the Material-ui library, and I used Storybook to develop the GUI components in isolation. Use `npm run storybook` to view them at localhost:9009.

`npm start` to run the app in development mode at localhost:3000.

Note that both Storybook, and the app in development mode proxy api requests to localhost:5000.
